# DoubleFurnace
Factorio Mod which adds a double furnace to the game.

A double furnace looks similar to an electric furnace (in green)
and it can smelt iron ore directly to steel.

# Installation
Download the zip from GitHub and unzip it in your Factorio mods folder.
The unpacked folder will most probably have the name "DoubleFurnace-master".
You need to rename it to "DoubleFurnace_#CurrentVersion" where CurrentVersion needs to be replaced by the version found in info.json
